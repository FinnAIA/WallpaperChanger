# Wallpaper changer
  This is a powershell script which changes your wallpaper, instead of using the "Powershell portal" you can also just open Powershell on your computer manually.
## installation
  **First** download all files into a folder on your computer. Once you have done that rename/download your wallpaper('s) to the format "wallpaperX.jpg" where x is the wallpaper number, eg:
  -wallpaper1.jpg
  -wallpaper3.jpg

  **Next** to use the program simpily open the wallpaper.txt and at the top change "$num = x" to whatever wallpaper you want to use (for exsample, if i want to use "wallpaper1" would change "$num = x" to "$num = 1" you also need to change the file directory (where it says "C:\filepath to instilation folder\wallpaper$num.jpg"") to the directory where you saved the previous files are stored.

  
  **Next** open the PS portal.bat file or open powershell. Then copy the entire content of the txt file (ctrl + A) and paste it into the open Termanal, once it has copied sicsessfuly just press enter and your wallpaper should change after a couple of seconds.
